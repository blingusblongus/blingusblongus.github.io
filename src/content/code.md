Take a look at some of my work! While my focus recently has been on work I'm not allowed to share, here are a few places to see some of my code and thought process.

## Advent of Code

While this isn't a _project_, per se, I like putting this up top because I come back to it often, and always learn something new when I add to it, or refactor old solutions. Recently, I've been moving my solutions from all years and languages to a single repository to reflect, refactor, and explore new languages.

[Check out my typescript, python, and rust solutions here](https://github.com/blingusblongus/aoc-collected).

## Cribbage Trainer

<div class="md:flex gap-5">
    <div>
My solo project from Prime Academy was a Cribbage Training App, with two modes:

1. A training mode that interactively teaches the different types of scoring combinations of cribbage.
2. A challenge mode that consists of a series of rounds, in which the user chooses to discard 2 cards from a random set of 6, with the goal of maximizing in-hand points. The app then finds the statistically best choice, and shows data comparing the user's choice and the optimal choice.

While it's no longer hosted on heroku (RIP free tier), [the source code is available here](https://github.com/blingusblongus/cribbage-trainer).

## SC Language Map

A group project from Prime Academy, the SC Language Map was an MVP built with React and Node.js. It used the Mapbox API to interactively map and display information about endangered languages in South Carolina, and the locations where they're spoken.
