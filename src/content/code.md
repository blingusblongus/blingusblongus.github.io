Take a look at some of my work! While my focus recently has been on professional work I can't share, here are a few places to see some of my code and thought process.

## Advent of Code

While this isn't a _project_, per se, I like putting this up top because I come back to it often, and always learn something new when I add to it, or refactor old solutions. Recently, I've been moving my solutions from all years and languages to a single repository to reflect, refactor, and explore new languages.

## Cribbage Trainer

My solo project from Prime Academy was a Cribbage Training App, with two modes:

1. A training mode that interactively teaches the different types of scoring combinations of cribbage.
2. A challenge mode that consists of a series of rounds, in which the user chooses to discard 2 cards from a random set of 6, with the goal of maximizing in-hand points. The app then finds the statistically best choice, and shows data comparing the user's choice and the optimal choice.

While it's no longer hosted on heroku (RIP free tier), [the source code is available here](https://github.com/blingusblongus/cribbage-trainer).

## Now Experience Component Articles

One of my interesting projects early on was to research a new framework for the company I was working for at the time, evaluate opportunities for using it in future projects, and share my findings with the team and the community. The framework was designed to integrate with a specific SaaS product, and was very early in adoption. Though the code demos I wrote were handed over when I got my next job, a couple of the articles I wrote are still available:

## SC Language Map

A group project from Prime Academy, the SC Language Map was an MVP built with React and Node.js. It used the Mapbox API to interactively map and display information about endangered languages in South Carolina, and the locations where they're spoken.
