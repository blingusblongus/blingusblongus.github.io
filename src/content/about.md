title: About Me

For me, there's no joy greater than attaining an understanding of something you've set your sights on. Growing up, it drew me to music, as every new techniqueand theoretical concept was another open door to creativity. At the beginning of my professional life, I fell in love with teaching, sharing expertise with those around me.

Finally, during COVID, on a friend's recommendation, I took the plunge into software dev - one of the best decisions I've ever made. I discovered a world in which every day of work is a new learning experience, and an opportunity to both learn from and teach those around me.

In my experience in software dev, every day is growth - I'm excited to tackle work each day, because everything I learn opens another door. I'm excited to see what's next!
