It's easy to get caught up in the hype when it comes to new and unique tools and frameworks in the software dev space. Just recently, we saw this with the release of [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - a javascript runtime that certainly offers some advantages over Node.js, but as people are discovering, may not be the miracle of performance it claims to be.

However, it's hard to come away from an experience with [Astro.js](http://astro.build) without the sneaking suspicion that, just maybe, the age of the Single-Page Application is already on the decline.

I don't think SPAs are going anywhere for a while, but in the process of trying out and building this site, I certainly came to understand why Astro is one of the most-loved frameworks for web development.

## Why Astro?

I first heard about Astro through the buzz on youtube and Twitter.

## Downsides

Unfortunately, despite all the great features that Astro provides developers, the space it dominates is still pretty niche. It operates in an interesting, liminal space, where you _can_ build all kinds of things with it, but because the main focus seems to be on the _developer experience_, it's not a clear choice for any specialized app.

You _can_ build a full SPA on an Astro page, but if that's what your app requires, you'd probably be better served sticking to one of the SPA mainstay frameworks.

It _is_ simple and quick to set up and update a static blog, landing page, or wiki, but unless devs are the ones updating the content, it's unlikely you'd really utilize the advantages of generating SSG from Markdown and build time instead of driving SSR with a CMS like any other framework.

And though it provides a remarkable amount of expressiveness with a relatively low skill floor, it's still far too technical for someone who just wants to build a simple site and can turn to Squarespace or Webflow instead.
